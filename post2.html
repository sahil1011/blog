                  Wallet Security –An emerging trending in Cryptocurrencies
Sahil Arora 						
(CSE 4th year, Hmritm)
Introduction-
Various threat of wallet security is emerging day-by-day to trend, on account of several recent attack since the emergence of crypto currency in 2009.These attacks not only effects the concerned holder of wallet, these can also be used to fund illegal activities .From many years these activities lag behind its development due to lack of proper means to fund these unaccounted activities. These acts of surpassing the wallet security has extended the limitation of exploiting the resources but also result in defying the government established security protocols for verified transactions .Hence, leave these platform an easy target for attacks .These attacks not only leave any susceptible clause for the occurrence of their happening, but also leave these links vulnerable for repeated harassment of resources. Thus making these wallets more scribe to be used by the software offering better authentication and authorization for identity. It should also solve the problem of maintaining honest nodes of mining chain to prevent dishonest node with resources to influence the blocks chaining. It should also prevent monopoly of miner from influencing the lead to current system centralization. Hence, Wallet will solve this current problem by better verification of signature for a transaction, faster transfer, better consensus method and more secure end to end node validator.





Proof Of Work-
Consensus methods are used in blockchain development to achieve an agreement based upon adding value in distributed node in the network. Many Blockchains have a lot of things in common and function in similar ways, but one of the ways in which blockchains can be unique is the way consensus is reached. Consensus algorithm is a process in computer science used to achieve agreement on a single data value among distributed systems. A Blockchain digital database containing some information that can be simultaneously used and shared within a large decentralized, publicly accessible network. A blocks can be mined by many techniques-
1)	ASIC Mining-(Application-specific integrated circuit) it is a circuit that is customised for a specific use, it is considered the most optimized technique.
2)	CPU mining-it uses a computer’s processor to validate transactions in a proof of work consensus protocol.
3)	FPGA Mining — (Field-Programmable Gate Array mining)it is an circuit tailored for a specific computing task, making them several times faster at mining than normal processors.
4)	Cloud Mining — it means renting their external processing power to other miners for a allotted period of time
.
The Production of a proof of work is a random process with low probability, so it requires a lot of trial and error on average before a valid proof of work is generated. Bitcoin’s use of a Proof of Work system is one of the defining and unique characteristics it has as a cryptocurrency.

Transaction Life Cycle
1) A node requests a Transaction through a wallet.
2) Then it is broadcasted to all participation node in the  blockchain network.
3) Every node in this network checks for the transaction with some validation protocols  that are assigned by the head of the  blockchain .These are retained into a block and are accessed using hash. Hence, becoming a part of Blockchain.
Security Issues
The issues related to the security of the currency are the centre of the discussion from the beginning. Huge efforts are build up to make these currency, transaction and mining secure but still many threats persist in front of this virtual currency. 
1)	Selfish Mining
In this type of attacks selfish miners try to take on the honest miner work by wasting there computational power on wrong branch of block that is disclosed in public and keep mining the correct branch in private. This help them I earning huge profits. In general, honest miner will keep spending resources on a branch that will be terminated lately .
   2) Software Attacks 
Most of the wallets are web based rather than desktop application .Hence chances of web based attack increases on wallet. A proper authentication is required for verification that node accessing the wallet is true. Many web based attack like phishing, dos attack leave the wallet vulnerable.
     3) Double spending 
A double spend is an attack where the given set of coins is spent in more than one transaction. This attack can be detrimental effects to the recipients as it can affect the transaction validity.
4)	Finey attack
It involve pre-mine a block and spend the same coins before releasing transaction to invalidate the transaction.
5)	Greater than 50% attack
This involves having greater computational power of a network to reverse the transaction or less and to invalidate or validate the blocks in the chain to avoid verifying the honest transaction.
6)	Time Jacks
Like race attacks, attackers announces the inaccurate time stamps during the node connection. These alter the honest branch and attackers influencers only certain transactions.
7)	Race attacks-
These attacks includes sending both the transaction on either of honest or dishonest branch, on basis of the chances that one of the transaction gets validated.

Solution 
Hence Iexchange wallet is a platform that uses the hybrid consensus method that involves proof of work consensus method acknowledged by defined representative by master wallet holder, that to with award system for selecting the honest representative .These system also come with the penalising system for  master as well as selected representative to invest their stake  on wrong mining node. These representatives are elected on the basis of highest computing work done and to prevent the dishonest miners to influence the node tip of blockchain, other delegates should be deserted with the knowledge of other votes. This will allow them to apply stake on a chain and be free from other bias and influence.
Advantages 
1)	Will provide more security and less vulnerability.
2)	Provide control and increases transparency in the system.
3)	Decentralized nature of blockchain wallet.
4)	Freedom of payment and lower chances of chain validation related attacks.
Disadvantages 
1)	Higher token fee and risks for representatives.
2)	Less involvement for other non-representative miner.
3)	More prone to group of representatives having different nodes but shares a common ideology and means to communicate which lead to influencing the dishonest chain.
Conclusion
Most of these attacks can be reduced by allowing a decentralized way of making wallet but on the other hand it also give rise to many new attacks and disadvantages that could have been persisted  ,if the current type of wallet security is promoted. Wallet security is always the main concern for developers and miners as it provide a safe day-to-day transactions and also provide a means to merchants to have it as a safe platform to apply for payments.
